.SH "NAME"
clld \- CL program source and binary linker

.SH SYNOPSIS

clld [options] [--cl-platform platform] [--cl-device device]
     [--cl-source] [--cl-binary]
     file...


.SH DESCRIPTION
clld combines a number of CL program source and binary files and generates a 
linkable ELF file with special sections that may be linked into an executable
program or shared library and loaded at run-time. 
.PP
clld generates thefollowing sections:
.TP 10
.IR .clprgs 
CL program source table
.TP
.IR .clprgb
CL program binary table
.TP
.IR .cltexts
CL program source text
.TP
.IR .cltextb
CL program binary text
.TP
.IR .clstrtab
string table referenced by other sections
.PP
The resulting ELF file is linkable and may be combined with a stndard linker
such as ld to incorporate these CL-specific sections into a program
executable or shared libary or relocatable object file.
.PP
The name of the output file generated by clld may be specified with -o and if
this option is not specified the default name "out_clld.o" is used.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
.RI "\-\-cl-device " device
Marks the files that follow as targeting a specific /fIdevice/fP.
.TP
.RI "\-\-cl-binary " 
The files that follow will be interpreted as CL source files.  This option
may be used as many times as necessary.
.TP
.RI "\-\-cl-platform " platform
Marks the files that follow as targeting a specific /fIplatform/fP.
.TP
.RI "\-\-cl-source "
The files that follow will be interpreted as CL binary files.  This option
may be used as many times as necessary.
.TP
.RI "\-o " filename
Use /fIfilename/fP as the name for the output file generated by clld.  If this
option is not used the name "out_clld.o" is used by default.

.SH EXAMPLE
clld --cl-device ATI_RADEON_5850 --cl-platform AMD_GPU --cl-source foo_kern.cl bar_kern.cl --cl-binary delta_kern.il -o my_prog_cl.o

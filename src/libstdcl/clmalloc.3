.SH DESCRIPTION
clmalloc() allocates memory suitable for sharing between compute layer (CL)
co-processor devices within a CL context.  
clmalloc() allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
The memory is not cleared.  If size is 0, then clmalloc() returns a unique 
pointer value that can later be safely passed to clfree().  If called with
the flag CL_MEM_DETACHED the allocation will no be attached to a CL context.
.PP
clmrealloc() re-allocates memory suitable for sharing between compute layer 
(CL) co-processor devices within a CL context.  If ptr is 0 or NULL clmalloc()
is called.  If size is 0, then clmalloc() returns a unique
pointer value that can later be safely passed to clfree().
.PP
clfree() frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must have been
returned by a previous call to clmalloc().  
Otherwise, or if clfree(ptr) has already been called before, the behavior is 
undefined.  It is considered an error to call clfree(ptr) if ptr is 0 or NULL.
.PP
clmctl() and clmctl_va() are used to control the state of the allocated memory.
The only distinction is that clmctl_va() accepts a va_list directly.
.PP
clsizeofmem() returns the size of the allocated memory associated with ptr.
If ptr does not reference memory allocated by a call to clmalloc(), and for
which clfree() has not been called, the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If successful clmalloc(3) returns a pointer to the allocated memory that is 
suitably aligned and suitable for sharing with CL co-processor devices.  
On error, returns NULL.
.PP
clfree() returns no value.
.PP
clsizeofmem() returns the size in bytes of the memory pointed to by ptr.

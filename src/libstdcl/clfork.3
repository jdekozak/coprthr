.SH NAME
clfork \- Execute a CL kernel 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdcl.h>
.sp
.BI "cl_event clfork( CLCONTEXT* " cp ", unsigned int " devnum ", cl_kernel " krn ", clndrange_t* " ndr ", int " flags );
.sp
Link with \fI\-lstdcl\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
clfork() is used to execute a CL kernel on a specified compute layer (CL)
co-processor device.  The arguments for the kernel must be set prior to
the call to clfork() using the clarg_set*() functions.  The kernel is executed
over an index-space of work-items defined by \fIndr\fP.
.PP
The behavior of clfork() can be controlled using the following flags:
.TP
.B CL_EVENT_WAIT
clfork() will block until the operation has completed.
.TP
.B CL_EVENT_NOWAIT
clfork() will return immediately.  The programmer must ensure that the
operation has completed using clwait() or clwaitev().
.TP
.B CL_EVENT_NORELEASE
Used with CL_EVENT_WAIT to prevent clfork() from releasing the CL event 
generated
by the operation.  If this flag is used the programmer is responsible
for releasing the returned event using clReleaseEvent().  This flag has
no effect when CL_EVENT_NOWAIT is used.
.B CL_EVENT_RELEASE
This flag is deprecated and should no longer be used.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On error clfork() will return (cl_event)(-1) and errno is set appropriately.

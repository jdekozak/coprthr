.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions clopen(), clsym(), clclose(), and clerror() implement an
interface for dynamically loading compute layer (CL) kernels.
.PP
The function clopen() loads the CL source or binary program file named by the
NULL-terminated string filename and returns an opaque handle that may be used
as a reference in subsequent calls.  If filename is a NULL pointer then a
handle for the main program executable is returned.  If the flag CLLD_NOBUILD
is used then the CL source will not be compiled.  This may be used
to defer the compilation and build to the clbuild() call which can accept
compiler options.
.PP
The function clbuild() is used for defered compilation and allows compiler 
options to be passed.  The combination of clopen() with the flag CLLD_NOBUILD
and clbuild() is equivalent to a standard clopen() call.
.PP
The funcion clsym() takes a handle to a CL source or binary program and a
NULL-terminated symbol name and returns the associated CL kernel.  A CL
context pointer must be specififed to identify the 
appropriate CL kernel to return.  If handle is NULL then all CL programs
loaded into the specified CL context are searched.
.PP
The function clclose() decrements the reference count on the associated handle.
If the reference count drops to zero then the CL program is unloaded.
The function clclose() returns the reference count on success and -1 on error.
.PP
The function clerror() returns a human readable string describing the most
recent error that has occured as a result of a call to any of the functions
clopen(), clsym(), clclose() since the last call to clerror().  If no error
has occured NULL is returned.
.PP
The function claddr() takes as an argument a CL kernel and tries to resolve
the name and file where it is located.  Information is returned in the
cl_kernel_info structure:
.sp
.in +4n
.nf
struct cl_kernel_info {
	const char* cli_fname;
	CLCONTEXT* cli_cp;
	unsigned int cli_devnum;
	const char* cli_kname;
};
.fi
.in
.PP
If no matching kernel is found the fields are set to NULL.  claddr() returns
zero on error and non-zero on success.

.TH CLMATTACH "3" "2011-6-13" "libstdcl-1.2" "Standard Compute Layer (CL) Manual"
.SH NAME
clmattach, clmdetach \- Attach and detach memory from a CL context
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <stdcl.h>
.sp
int clmattach( CLCONTEXT* cp, void* ptr );
.sp
int clmdetach( void* ptr );
.sp
Link with \fI\-lstdcl\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
clmattach() is used to attach memory to a compute layer (CL) context. 
The memory pointed to by \fIptr\fP must be allocated with clmalloc() and 
suitable for sharing between the host and CL co-processor devices.
In order to change the attachment of memory from one CL context
to another, the memory must first be unattached using a call to clmdetach().
It is an error to pass clmattach() memory that is already attached to a CL 
context.
.PP
clmdetach() is used to detach memory from a CL context.  
The memory pointed to by \fIptr\fP must be allocated with clmalloc() and 
suitable for sharing between the host and CL co-processor devices.
.PP
If ptr does not point to memory allocated by clmalloc() the behavior of
clmattach() and clmdetach() is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Both clmattach() and clmdetach() return 0 on success.  On error, -1 is
returned and errno is set appropriately.
